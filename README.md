## phosphor-css

Unlike `phosphor-icons`, `phosphor-css` isn't loading any fonts. Instead, CSS is loaded, and SVG icons are requested when required. It is possible to load a multi- or single-weight CSS file (e.g. "regular" or "fill"), allowing for even more performant use.

## Installation

```bash
npm i phosphor-css
```

## Usage

By default, icons are the size of 1.5rem (24px). `width`, `height`, `background-color` (final icon colour) and `line-height` can be modified when targetting `.ph.icon`.

```css
@import 'phosphor-css/css/index.css';
@import 'phosphor-css/sass/index.scss';
@import 'phosphor-css/less/index.less';

/* @import "phosphor-css/{language}/{weight}.{language}"; */
```

```html
<!-- regular -->
<i class="ph icon heart" />
```

```html
<!-- bold -->
<i class="ph icon heart bold" />
```
